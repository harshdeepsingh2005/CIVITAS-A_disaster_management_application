## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

#### **"Web Bluetooth not supported"**
- Ensure you're using Chrome browser
- Enable experimental web platform features
- Check if your device has Bluetooth capability

#### **"No devices found"**
- Make sure other Civitas devices are nearby
- Check if devices are powered on and in range
- Try refreshing the discovery

#### **"Connection failed"**
- Verify Bluetooth is enabled on your device
- Check Chrome has Bluetooth permissions
- Ensure the target device is not already connected

#### **"Permission denied"**
- Click "Allow" when Chrome prompts for Bluetooth access
- Check Chrome settings for Bluetooth permissions
- Try refreshing the page and reconnecting

### **Debug Information**
- Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
- Check Console tab for error messages
- Monitor Network tab for API calls
- Use Application tab to check service worker status
